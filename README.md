# VEMOD-Plotter
This program allows plotting simulation results (at transient or steady state operating conditions) from [VEMOD](https://gitlab.com/OpenWAM/openwam-dev/-/releases) and compare them with the experimental measurements.

See the readme at the [project page](https://victor-aunon.github.io/VEMOD-Plotter/).
